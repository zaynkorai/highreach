### 1. Capture (AI Inbound)

*   **Drag & Drop Surveys And Forms**: Built right in is the ability to capture leads through versatile surveys and forms. You can integrate directly with our page builder or embed them on your own sites.

Stop sending generic spam. Run behavior-based, generative campaigns.
*   **Generative Nurture**: AI writes custom SMS/Email follow-ups based on the lead's specific inquiry.
*   **Predictive Workflows**: "Leads like this usually buy after 3 days. Scheduling follow-up for Tuesday."
*   **Multi-Channel Reach**: Voicemail drops, SMS, and Email orchestrated by AI.

### 3. Close (AI Sales)
Use our built in tools to collect payments, schedule appointments, and track analytics!
*   **Manage Your Workflow And Pipeline**: With our built-in Pipeline Management feature, you can keep track of where the leads are and what stage they are in the sales funnel.
*   **AI Booking Agent**: Negotiates slots and puts meetings on your calendar.
*   **Payment Links**: Auto-generated invoices sent inside the chat.
