## 💰 Pricing Review

### Proposed Tiers
| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Starter** | $49/mo | Inbox + Missed Call + CRM |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | + Pipeline + Calendar + Reviews |
| **Agency** | $199/mo | + White-label |

### Competitive Analysis
| Competitor | Pricing | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| GoHighLevel | $97-497/mo + agency fees | Simpler, no middlemen |
| Calendly | $12-20/mo (booking only) | All-in-one + SMS |

### ⚠️ PO Questions

2. **SMS costs** — Should we include X SMS/mo or charge per message?
3. **Annual discount** — Offer 2 months free for annual?

## 🎯 Target Market Validation

### Primary Persona
> **"Busy Bob"** — A plumber who misses 40% of calls while on jobs.  
> Uses spreadsheets, has a 3.2-star Google rating, hates complex software.

### Market Size (US)
| Vertical | Businesses | TAM @ $99/mo |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Plumbers | 120,000 | $142M/yr |

|---------|----------|------|
| Google Ads ("CRM for plumbers") | P0 | Paid |

### Key Sales Triggers (from lite.md)

### Strategic Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Market Opportunity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | GHL pain points are real, SMB market is huge |
| Positioning | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "Speed to Lead" is clear, but needs sharper hook |
| Pricing | ⭐⭐⭐ | Needs refinement — see below |
| GTM | ⭐⭐⭐ | Missing viral/referral mechanics |
| Metrics | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Realistic targets, good baseline |

### 🎯 My Decisions on the 6 Questions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **1. Pricing** | ✅ **Approve $49 Starter** but add a **Free tier** | Free tier drives signups. Convert to paid for SMS/phone features. |
| **2. SMS** | ✅ **Bundled: 500 SMS/mo** (Starter), 2000/mo (Pro) | Predictable costs for customers. Overage at $0.01/SMS. |
| **3. Annual** | ✅ **2 months free** for annual | Standard SaaS practice. Improves cash flow. |
| **4. Vertical** | ✅ **Plumbers ONLY for launch** | Focus wins. Nail one ICP before expanding. |
| **5. Trial** | ✅ **14-day free trial** | 7 days too short for SMBs to evaluate. No credit card required. |
| **6. Onboarding** | ✅ **Self-serve + optional setup call (Pro+)** | Scale with self-serve, white-glove for higher tiers. |

---

### 🚨 Critical Additions Required

| Addition | Why | Priority |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **Free tier** | Every successful SMB tool has a free tier (HubSpot, Calendly). Captures leads that aren't ready to pay. | P0 |
| **Referral program** | "Give $20, Get $20" — SMBs trust peer recommendations. | P1 |
| **Case study by day 30** | Get ONE plumber success story. "Bob increased calls answered by 50%." | P0 |
| **Exit intent offer** | 30% off first month if they try to leave trial. | P1 |

---

### 💰 Revised Pricing Recommendation

| Tier | Price | SMS Included | Features |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 50 SMS/mo | Inbox (email only), CRM, Forms |
| **Starter** | $49/mo | 500 SMS/mo | + Missed call text-back, SMS inbox |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | 2,000 SMS/mo | + Pipeline, Calendar, Reviews, Workflows |
| **Agency** | $199/mo | 5,000 SMS/mo | + White-label, Multi-location |

*Overage: $0.01/SMS after limit*

[SENIOR PO SIGNATURE]

Approved with conditions noted above.
Focus on plumbers. Ship fast. Get one case study.

The "Speed to Lead" positioning is good but consider:
→ "Never Miss Another Call" (more concrete)
→ "Your 24/7 Front Desk" (for service businesses)

Start with plumbers, expand to dentists in 60 days if metrics hold.
