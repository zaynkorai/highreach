# Documentation & Task Breakdown

## Docs Rules

1. **Update docs after every code change** — if code changed, docs must reflect it in the same session.
2. **Docs = source of truth** — code and docs must never contradict each other.
3. **Doc what matters** — API contracts, config, architecture decisions. Skip obvious boilerplate.
4. **Delete stale docs** — outdated docs are worse than no docs.

## Task Breakdown Rules

1. **Atomic tasks only** — each task = one clear, small deliverable.
2. **No complex multi-step implementations in one go** — break into sequential manageable chunks.
3. **Each task must be independently verifiable** — you can confirm it works on its own.
4. **Task checklist before coding** — write the breakdown first, then implement step by step.
5. **One concern per task** — don't mix refactoring with new features in the same task.
